## About
This repo is a personal collection of mini projects I have created while learning and practicing web development.  
It will be continuously updated with more projects covering:
- HTML basics
- CSS layouts, animations, responsive design

ðŸ“Œ **Note:** All projects are **responsive-ready** and tested on desktop browsers.  
Some features may not work when opened directly from file â€” use a local server or GitHub Pages.
